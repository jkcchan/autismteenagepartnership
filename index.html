          <div class="abouttext">
            <h2>Initiative</h2>
            <p>Autism Teenage Partnership (ATP) is an initiative dedicated to providing accessible, free, and safe spaces for teens diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We support individuals with ASD by delivering weekly social programming that enables them to express themselves through games, crafts, and team-building activities.</p>
            <p>ATP currently runs every Wednesday nights from 6-8pm at Milliken Park Community Recreation Centre, located at the south-east corner of McCowan Road and Steeles Avenue E.  </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Autism Awareness initiative was started as a university club at Western University by Janson Chan and Brandon Wildfong. The club became known as Autism Awareness at Western (AAW) and continues to run with over 120 members raising autism awareness. When Janson returned to the GTA to study at YorkU, he became involved with their Agent’s of Change Program enabling him to establish Autism Awareness at York University (AAY). </p>
            <p>AAY was launched as Autism Teenage Partnership in the summer of 2014 and has helped over 25 participants in the local GTA and neighbouring Markham area. Our program only continues to grow with widespread success and continued support for teens with ASD and their families.</p>                        
            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>Autism Teenage Partnership aims to positively impact the lives of individuals diagnosed with autism and their families through:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Fostering the development of social skills and friendships to enhance quality of life and form social support networks. </li>
              <li>Allow for easy integration into society through the creation of inclusive and safe environments. </li>
              <li>Work with local agencies to develop relationships and raise awareness of Autism Spectrum Disorders.</li>
              <li>Develop toolkits for others to initiate ATP Chapters in underserved regions in Ontario.</li>
            </ol>
